# Doctor Booking UI

A responsive, accessible appointment booking UI built with React & TailwindCSS.

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Zustand (state management)
- Mock data (no backend)

## Features

- Doctor Directory View with filters (specialty, availability)
- Booking Modal with time slots
- My Appointments Summary View Modal
- Fully responsive
- Accessible via keyboard
- Uses `aria-*`, roles, and Lighthouse-passed accessibility

## How AI Tools Were Used

- ChatGPT: Helped scaffold components, optimize accessibility, and generate mock data.

## Known Limitations

- Time slots are mocked and not dynamically generated per doctor or day
- Minimal test coverage; only basic UI behavior is verified
- No animations or transitions for modal open/close
- Didnâ€™t add all the units tests due to time constraints.
- No form validation in the booking flow

## Next Steps

- Add support for dynamic time slots based on doctor's real schedule
- Expand unit test coverage using React Testing Library
- Implement pagination or infinite scroll for long doctor lists
- Add animated transitions for modals and UI components
- Support rescheduling of appointments
- use react-helmet to optimize SEO
